Question 1:

Consider the following symbol replacement rules:

Rule 1: T(x,y) ==> x
Rule 2: F(x,y) ==> y
Rule 3: N(x) ==> x(F,T)

Using these rules, show that N(T) ==> F.

Answer: 

N(T) ==> T(F,T) ==> F (GPT3 response)

Question 2:

Using the same rules, show that N(F) = T.

Answer:  

N(F) ==> F(F,T) ==> T (GPT3 response)

Question 3:
